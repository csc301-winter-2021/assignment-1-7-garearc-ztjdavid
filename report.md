# CSC301 Assignment 1 Report
 
## 1. Project decision analysis
+ Platform
    + We considered website and mobile options to implement the checkout calculator and decided that we would choose the website. To begin with, we did some research on mobile development. One advantage of using a mobile platform is that it allows the applications to store their database on a local mobile device. With instant data retrieval and the nature of mobile programming languages, the performance of a mobile platform is higher than a website. In contrast, website stores most of the user data on a remote server, which is costly and dependent on the network quality. However, we discovered that while mobile platforms usually offer better performance and do not require a stable network connection, there are several problems with it. The largest and foremost problem is compatibility. Mobile platforms such as IOS and Android are often competing opponents and therefore would obstruct any cross-platform interactions. In addition, mobile apps are highly dependent on mobile OS. In other words, if there are many users on different versions of mobile OS, it would be the developer's responsibility to make the app compatible with all versions of OS. As opposed to mobile App, website development is much more versatile. It mostly does not rely on any specific browser or running environment. Furthermore, the cost of development is much lower than it is on a mobile platform for building a small-sized project. Some mobile App stores also have different regulations on what kind of App is allowed for users to download. In short, our team agreed on the website platform after careful consideration and evaluation of both options.
 
+ Front-end
    + The front-end component is the largest part of our project. We assessed three options: Vue, React, and Angular, and Vue is the one that stands out. While react is the most-used front-end tool, it is unfit for our project. React’s large user base makes react a fast-paced developing library. On one hand, react constantly updates its library so that more developers can fulfill their needs timely. On the other hand, the documentation and instructions on how to use the tool are not sufficiently provided and updated. Especially when it comes to new front-end developers, it would be challenging to learn and put it into practice in a short period of time. Similarly, angular is created for enterprise-level software developments. It has a steep learning curve and someone new to the front-end would need to spend more time to grasp the fundamentals of areas such as dependency injections and binding. Additionally, the load time of the binding process is known to be longer than React due to its two-way binding data. Conversely, Vue’s virtual DOM can provide fast compile and runtime. My team member has previous experience with Vue. His explanation alongside the intuitive nature of the framework makes it straightforward to learn. Vue always provides two-way binding so that updates on UI or DOM can be carried over to the other end. Moreover, Vue has a highly customizable GUI in CLI which is a convenient feature that many other frameworks do not offer. These are the features that made Vue the best-rated front-end framework on the Github repository. In conclusion, Vue suits our demands best due to its versatility, approachability, and performance.
 
+ Back-end
    + Our group picked three options for the backend framework: Spring, Express, and Flask. Each option uses a different language: Java, Javascript, and Python respectively. Firstly, Javascript and Python are dynamic-type languages. It is flexible in that a type does not need to be fixed to fit in different contexts; nevertheless, it could also lead to some stability problems. Since our website does not have many use cases at this stage. A stable language such as Java with static types is much more ideal. Secondly, Spring offers Inversion of Control and Aspect-Oriented Programming while the other two do not. These functionalities allow a more structural dependency relationship. Some of these features are new to us, but luckily, Spring has a very large community which makes getting help and learning by ourselves more accessible. Thirdly, Spring has a decent database and library support. Spring is accommodating when it comes to databases. It is compatible with H2, MySQL, Redis, and many other types of Databases. In contrast, Flask does not have built-in database support. We have not decided whether or not to include a database in our final design, but choosing a more generous framework in the planning process may open up more possibilities in the future. Lastly, Java is a more familiar language for us since we have worked with it to create projects in CSC207. Based on these considerations, we agreed upon choosing Spring as the framework for our project.
 
+ CI/CD
    + Between Travis CI, Circle CI, and Git Action, our group picked Git Action. Both Travis CI and Circle CI are more targeted at enterprise-level users. They are only free for open-source projects. Therefore, the community support for these two tools is not as accessible as Git Action. My group is completely new to CI/CD, hence easy to use is our priority. In this regard, Git Action is incorporated into Github and can generate the YML file smoothly after pushing our codes on the Github Repository.

+ Database
  + In assignment one, we did not include a database. To plan ahead, we decided to use PostgreSQL instead of MongoDB or MySQL. We have more experience with PostgreSQL since it is taught in a database course which we are both taking. We learned that PostgreSQL supports more different data types by using a relational database management system, whereas MySQL and MongoDB are limited in this aspect for using a purely relational and a document database system respectively. We also found out that PostgreSQL genuinely has better performance with complex queries and a high number of client connections. Despite MySQL is more intuitive to learn for people with experience in javascript, its support plans from Oracle are paid. Overall, PostgreSQL fits our project the best.
